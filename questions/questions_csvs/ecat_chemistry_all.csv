Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT $\rightarrow P V T=n R=c$ onstant
The question states that the pressure and moles (n) are held constant; therefore, the volume and temperature are directly proportional. If the question were asking about an ideal gas, the volume would double when you double the temperature
\[
V_{0} T_{0}=x 2 \quad\left(T_{0}\right) \rightarrow x=2 V_{0}
\]
The volume would double for an ideal gas; however, the question is asking about a real gas. To find the correct relationship between volume and temperature we need to look at the equation for real gas volume. Remember that the volume we are concerned with is the volume of the free space in the container, given by the container volume minus the volume of the gas particles. The equation for real gas volume accounts for the volume of the container and the volume of the gas particles. For a real gas, the volume is given as follows:
$V_{\text {REAL }}=V_{\text {CONTAINER }}-(n * b)$
In this equation, $n$ is the number of moles of gas particles and $b$ is the bigness coefficient. This equation implies that the volume of free space for a real gas is always less than the volume for an ideal gas; therefore, doubling the temperature will produce a volume that is less than the predicted volume for an ideal gas. Our answer, then, must be less than double the initial volume.
Note that for an ideal gas the bigness coefficient, $b$ b, would be zero and the volume of free space $\left(V_{\text {ideal}}\right)$ would be equal to the volume of the container $\left(V_{\text {container}}\right) .$ This occurs because the volume of the gas particles is negligible for an ideal gas.",,49,The volume will become greater than 2 V$_\circ$,The volume will become less than 2 $_\circ$,The volume will become 0.5 $_\circ$,The volume will become 2 $_\circ$,,,,,2,,,

Which of the following would have a negative attraction coefficient, a, if found in the gaseous state?",,difficult,"The question wants you to pick a molecule that will have a negative attraction coefficient, a. The question states that the molecules that repel each other will have a negative a. Recall that similar charges repel each other; therefore, you are looking for an ionized molecule (molecule with a positive or negative charge). In a closed container, these molecules will be forced into contact with each other and generate repulsion forces.

Dichloromethane $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right)$ is a neutral molecule. This means that the dichloromethane molecules won't repel each other. Similarly, sodium chloride is a neutral molecule and will not experience repulsion. Oxygen, with an electron configuration of $1 \mathrm{s}^{2} 2 \mathrm{s}^{2} 2 \mathrm{p}^{4}$ is also a neutral molecule. If you look at the periodic table, the neutral state of oxygen occurs when there are six valence electrons. The outermost shell of oxygen in this electron configuration $(n=2)$ has a total of six electrons; therefore, the oxygen has six valence electrons and is neutral.
On the other hand, magnesium, with an electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6},$ is not neutral. Recall that a neutral magnesium atom has two valence electrons and an electron configuration of $1 \mathrm{s}^{2} 2 \mathrm{s}^{2} 2 \mathrm{p}^{6} 3 \mathrm{s}^{2}$ The magnesium atom in this question, however, has lost two electrons (from the 3s orbital) and became positively charged with a charge of $+2 ;$ therefore, the magnesium atoms are ionized, will repel each other, and will have a negative a.",,49,Magnesium with an electron configuration of $1s^2$$2s^2$$2p^6$,Sodium chloride,Dichloromethane,Oxygen with an electron configuration of $1s^2$$2s^2$$2p^2$,,,,,1,,,

Supplementary info: A displacement reaction is the one wherein the atom or a set of atoms is displaced by another atom in a molecule. For instance, when Iron is added to a copper sulphate solution, it displaces the copper metal. $A + B-C \rightarrow A-C + B$. The above equation exists when A is more reactive than B. A double displacement reaction is a type of reaction in which two reactants exchange ions to form two new compounds. Double displacement reactions typically result in the formation of a product that is a precipitate. Double displacement reactions take the form: $AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB$. Whereas Reduction is the loss of oxygen atom from a molecule or the gaining of one or more electrons. A reduction reaction is seen from the point of view of the molecule being reduced, as when one molecule gets reduced another gets oxidized. The full reaction is known as a Redox reaction.

Free radical mechanism of halogenation of alkenes follow which of the following steps?,,moderate,"Because of their high reactivity, free radicals have the potential to be both extremely powerful chemical tools and extremely harmful contaminants. Much of the power of free radical species stems from the natural tendency of radical processes to occur in a chain reaction fashion. Radical chain reactions have three distinct phases: initiation, propagation, and termination.
The initiation phase describes the step that initially creates a radical species. In most cases, this is a homolytic cleavage event, and takes place very rarely due to the high energy barriers involved. Often the influence of heat, UV radiation, or a metal-containing catalyst is necessary to overcome the energy barrier.
Molecular chlorine and bromine will both undergo homolytic cleavage to form radicals when subjected to heat or light. Other functional groups which also tend to form radicals when exposed to heat or light are chlorofluorocarbons, peroxides, and the halogenated amide N-Bromo succinimide (NBS).
The propagation phase describes the 'chain' part of chain reactions. Once a reactive free radical is generated, it can react with stable molecules to form new free radicals. These new free radicals go on to generate yet more free radicals, and so on. Propagation steps often involve hydrogen abstraction or addition of the radical to double bonds.
Chain termination occurs when two free radical species react with each other to form a stable, non-radical adduct. Although this is a very thermodynamically downhill event, it is also very rare due to the low concentration of radical species and the small likelihood of two radicals colliding with one another. In other words, the Gibbs free energy barrier is very high for this reaction, mostly due to entropic rather than enthalpic considerations. The active sites of enzymes, of course, can evolve to overcome this entropic barrier by positioning two radical intermediates adjacent to one another.",http://d15o1jx56rxevg.cloudfront.net/ecat/chemistry/c19_Alliphatic_hydrocarbons/e21.PNG,75,Termination,Initiation,Propagation,All of these,,,,,4,,,

Reaction intermediates are formed in one step and then consumed in a later step of the reaction mechanism. The slowest step in the mechanism is called the rate determining or rate-limiting step. 
Supplementary info: Molecularity in chemistry is the number of molecules that come together to react in an elementary reaction and is equal to the sum of stoichiometric coefficients of reactants in this elementary reaction. Depending on how many molecules come together, a reaction can be unimolecular, bimolecular or trimolecular. activated state is a state in which chemical reactants are at their highest energy level, which is related to the potential energy in high-energy phosphates. A reversible reaction is a reaction where the reactants and products react together to give the reactants back. A and B can react to form C and D or, in the reverse reaction, C and D can react to form A and B. This is distinct from reversible process in thermodynamics.

One type is the alpha ($\alpha$) helix structure. This structure resembles a coiled spring and is secured by hydrogen bonding in the polypeptide chain. The second type of secondary structure in proteins is the beta ($\beta$) pleated sheet. This structure appears to be folded or pleated and is held together by hydrogen bonding between polypeptide units of the folded chain that lie adjacent to one another. Tertiary Structure refers to the comprehensive 3-D structure of the polypeptide chain of a protein. There are several types of bonds and forces that hold a protein in its tertiary structure. Quaternary Structure refers to the structure of a protein macromolecule formed by interactions between multiple polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide chain is referred to as a subunit. Proteins with quaternary structure may consist of more than one of the same types of protein subunit. They may also be composed of different subunits. Hemoglobin is an example of a protein with quaternary structure. ",,81,Quantum structure,Secondary structure,Tertiary structure,Primary structure,,,,,2,,,

What we call the rigid rocky crust earth up to a depth of 100 km?,,easy,"A lithosphere is the rigid, outermost shell of a terrestrial-type planet, or natural satellite, that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties. On Earth, it is composed of the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater.
Supplementary info: The hydrosphere is the combined mass of water found on, under, and above the surface of a planet, minor planet or natural satellite. Although Earth's hydrosphere has been around for about 4 billion years, it continues to change in shape. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere and is also where nearly all-weather conditions take place. It contains $75\%$ of the atmosphere's mass and $25\%$ of the total mass of water vapour and aerosols. Magma is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed. Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites.",,83,Magma,Hydrosphere,Lithosphere,Troposphere,,,,,3,,,

Heat balance of earth is maintained by which of following sphere,,easy," The atmosphere is the blanket of gases which surrounds Earth. It is held near the surface of the planet by Earth's gravitational attraction. Without the atmosphere there could be no life on Earth. The atmosphere keeps the climate on Earth moderate compared to that of other planets. The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity.
