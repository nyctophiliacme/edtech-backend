"In the town of Agra there lived a rich businessman. But he was also quite a miser. Various people used to flock outside his house everyday hoping for some kind of generosity, but they always had to return home disappointed. He used to ward them off with false promises and then never lived up to his word. Then one day, a poet named Raidas arrived at his house and said that he wanted to read out his poems to the rich man. As the rich man was very fond of poetry, he welcomed him in with open arms.
Raidas started to recite all his poems one by one. The rich man was very pleased and especially so when he heard and especially so when he heard the poem that Raidas had written on him. In those days it was a custom for rich man and kings to show their appreciation through a reward or a gift, as that was the only means of earning that a poor poet possessed. So the rich man promised Raidas some gifts and asked him to come and collect them the next day, Raidas was pleased.
   The next morning when he arrived at the house, the rich man pretended that he had never laid eyes on him before. When Raidas reminded him of his promise, he said that although Raidas was a good poet he liked the poems which were written on him and rest of the poems were very ordinary. He also said that he had earlier promised a reward to Raidas not because he was really pleased or impressed but to simply encourage him. Raidas was extremely upset, but as there was nothing that he could do, he quietly left the house. On his way home he saw his brother Kuber riding a horse. So he stopped him and asked for his help after narrating the whole incident. Kuber took him to his own house in order to come up with a plan. Alter giving it to some thought he asked Raidas to go to a friend’s house with five gold coins and request the friend to plan a dinner where the rich man would also be invited. He then narrated his plan to him.
Raidas had one trustworthy friend whose name was Mayadas. So he went up to him and told him his plan. The next day, Mayadas went to the rich man’s house and invited him for the dinner. He said that he intended to serve his guests in vessels of gold, which the guests would get to take home after the meal. The rich man was thrilled to hear this and jumped at the offer. After the rich man arrived at Mayadas house, he was surprised to see no other guests there but Raidas. Anyhow, they welcomed him in and started a polite conversation. The rich man had come on an empty stomach and so was hungrier by the minute. Finally at midnight the rich man could bear his hunger no longer and asked Mayadas to serve the food. Mayadas sounded extremely surprised when he asked him what food he was talking about. The rich man tried to remind him that he had been invited for dinner. At this point Raidas asked him for the proof of the invitation. The rich man had no answer. At the point Raidas reminded the rich man of the same treatment that he had meted out to him. The rich man realized his mistake and begged for forgiveness. He said that Raidas was a good poet and had not asked him for any reward. He himself had promised to give him some gifts and then cheated him out of them. To make up for his mistake he took out the necklace that he was wearing and gifted it to Raidas. Then they all sat down to eat a happy meal.

The rich man had come on an empty stomach and so was hungrier by the minute. Finally at midnight the rich man could bear his hunger no longer and asked Mayadas to serve the food. Mayadas sounded extremely surprised when he asked him what food he was talking about. The rich man tried to remind him that he had been invited for dinner. At this point Raidas asked him for the proof of the invitation. The rich man had no answer. At the point Raidas reminded the rich man of the same treatment that he had meted out to him. The rich man realized his mistake and begged for forgiveness. He said that Raidas was a good poet and had not asked him for any reward. He himself had promised to give him some gifts and then cheated him out of them. To make up for his mistake he took out the necklace that he was wearing and gifted it to Raidas.

As the rich man was very fond of poetry, he welcomed him in with open arms.Raidas started to recite all his poems one by one. The rich man was very pleased and especially so when he heard and especially so when he heard the poem that Raidas had written on him. In those days it was a custom for rich man and kings to show their appreciation through a reward or a gift, as that was the only means of earning that a poor poet possessed. So the rich man promised Raidas some gifts and asked him to come and collect them the next day, Raidas was pleased.The next morning when he arrived at the house, the rich man pretended that he had never laid eyes on him before. When Raidas reminded him of his promise, he said that although Raidas was a good poet he liked the poems which were written on him and rest of the poems were very ordinary. He also said that he had earlier promised a reward to Raidas not because he was really pleased or impressed but to simply encourage him. Raidas was extremely upset, but as there was nothing that he could do, he quietly left the house. On his way home he saw his brother Kuber riding a horse. So he stopped him and asked for his help after narrating the whole incident. Kuber took him to his own house in order to come up with a plan.

"A Sobbing little girl stood near a small school from which she had been turned away because it was too crowded. “I can’t go to school”, she sobbed to a priest as he walked by. Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the priest guessed the reason and, talking by hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the school class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to study.
Some years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted priest, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside were found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read,  “This is to help make the little school bigger so more children can go to school”. For more years she had saved for this offering of love. When the priest tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the stage, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his assistants to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building. A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the school could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 percent payment.

A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the school could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 percent payment.
Religious members too made large subscriptions. Cheques came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl’s gift had increased up to $250, 000 huge sums for that time. Her unselfish love had paid large dividends. The school building houses hundreds of scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside at school time.

"Activity in the services sector shrank in September as new orders sank, a new survey shows. To add to these worries, overall economic activity is seen to be nearly stagnating, while employment levels fell for the second successive month.
The seasonally adjusted Service sector Business Activity Index fell to 49.8 from 53.8 in August, HSBC Purchasing Managers Index, which is based on a survey of 350 private sector executives, showed. Any reading of less than 50 indicates contraction, while economic activity is seen to be growing if the index is over 50. This is the first time since April 2009 that the services sector, that accounts for more than half the Indian economy, has slipped into negative terrain.
The decline in services sector activity could be attributed to lower demand for offshoring and IT and IT-enabled services from the US and Europe, where several economics are grappling with debt problems. There is also an impact on financial services as banking activity has slowed down on account of higher interest rates and investors are wary of parking their funds in stock markets.
At the moment, manufacturing activity is continuing to grow, though at a much slower pace. As a result, the HSBC India Composite Index-which covers manufacturing and services sector-stood at 50.2 in September, compared to 54.5 in August.
The trend is in line with expectations that the India economy will grow at less than 8% during the current financial year, with agriculture providing the only silver lining. Last year the economy expanded 8.5% prompting the government to predict 9% growth this year. But over the last few months, as the global economic situation deteriorated and higher interest rates slowed down the tempo, the government too is lowering its forecasts although not to the extent that others have done.
But it isn’t just services which are shrinking. The survey shows employment fell for the second successive month, increasing worries for policymakers, who want rapid economic growth to take care of the growing population that is joining the workforce.
Typically, a near-stagnant economy will encourage the central bank to start lowering interest rates to spur economic activity. But given the inflationary pressures, RBI is in no mood to do so and the debate is whether it will resort to further rate hikes or pause after increasing key policy rates a dozen times over the last 19 months. It is due to review its monetary policy later this month. The HSBC survey showed that inflation pressures are firmly in place though the rate is moderating a little. “We are getting close to the end of RBI’s tightening cycle, but we are not quite there yet.” An economist observed.

"Activity in the services sector shrank in September as new orders sank, a new survey shows. To add to these worries, overall economic activity is seen to be nearly stagnating, while employment levels fell for the second successive month.
The seasonally adjusted Service sector Business Activity Index fell to 49.8 from 53.8 in August, HSBC Purchasing Managers Index, which is based on a survey of 350 private sector executives, showed. Any reading of less than 50 indicates contraction, while economic activity is seen to be growing if the index is over 50. This is the first time since April 2009 that the services sector, that accounts for more than half the Indian economy, has slipped into negative terrain.
The decline in services sector activity could be attributed to lower demand for offshoring and IT and IT-enabled services from the US and Europe, where several economics are grappling with debt problems. There is also an impact on financial services as banking activity has slowed down on account of higher interest rates and investors are wary of parking their funds in stock markets.
At the moment, manufacturing activity is continuing to grow, though at a much slower pace. As a result, the HSBC India Composite Index-which covers manufacturing and services sector-stood at 50.2 in September, compared to 54.5 in August.
The trend is in line with expectations that the India economy will grow at less than 8% during the current financial year, with agriculture providing the only silver lining. Last year the economy expanded 8.5% prompting the government to predict 9% growth this year. But over the last few months, as the global economic situation deteriorated and higher interest rates slowed down the tempo, the government too is lowering its forecasts although not to the extent that others have done.
But it isn’t just services which are shrinking. The survey shows employment fell for the second successive month, increasing worries for policymakers, who want rapid economic growth to take care of the growing population that is joining the workforce.
Typically, a near-stagnant economy will encourage the central bank to start lowering interest rates to spur economic activity. But given the inflationary pressures, RBI is in no mood to do so and the debate is whether it will resort to further rate hikes or pause after increasing key policy rates a dozen times over the last 19 months.

"The oil industry was born in the United States around the time of the Civil War.

The growing uses of petroleum in modern American industrial society led several domestic companies to secure oil concessions in Mexico but foreign production was not actively sought after the First World War.

In the early 1920s, however, two fears seized the American oil industry. First, it was feared that in the not too distant future,” The position of the US regarding oil”, wrote the Director of US Geological Survey, “can best be characterized as precarious.”

Second, while a domestic oil shortage seemed imminent, so did the possibility that the major sources of petroleum outside North America would soon be locked up by foreign interests- primarily by British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell.

"Emanating from the Indian kitchens every morning are the appetizing aromas of crushed spices, lentils, curry leaves and vegetables and working with her deft fingers and loving heart is the woman of the house creating ‘the great Indian home cooked meal’.

This is where the ‘dabbawallas’ sensed a business opportunity way back in 1980 – the idea of delivering home cooked meals to office-goers and their workplace and returning empty meal boxes to their homes before their return in the evening.

Today ‘dabbawallas’ have become integral part of Mumbai’s cultural mosaic. About 5000 of these delivery men crisscross the streets, lanes and by lanes of Mumbai, on foot, bicycle and local train, every morning to deliver about 2,00,000 home cooked meal boxes to office goers at their workplaces. What amazes business strategists across the world is the unique process of near faultless delivery, which even convinced Forbes magazine to give them the highly-prized Sigma Six Rating for quality assurance, a feat achieved by companies such as Motorola and General Electrics.

“The success of the system depends on teamwork and time management that would be the envy of every modern manager. Such is the dedication and commitment of the barely literate and barefoot delivery men who form links in the extensive delivery chain, that there is no system of documentation at all.”

They do not rely on any high technology data bases or computers for communication. Instead they use colours and code markings for identification. “Each container carries an indelible ink alphanumeric coding of some ten characters signifying the various transfer and delivery stages, as well as the individuals who are to be involved in the process.”

One of the major reason for the success of this delivery service is the high-level of personal involvement, relationship orientation and continuous communication with their clients and amongst themselves.
Memorizing about 35 addresses from where they must pick up the boxes it becomes critical for the dabbawalla to keep the flow of information continuous as any miscommunication might result in the unpardonable error of serving a non-vegetarian meal to a pure vegetarian, an act blasphemous enough to wash away all the good deeds of the person in a single stroke.

"Emanating from the Indian kitchens every morning are the appetizing aromas of crushed spices, lentils, curry leaves and vegetables and working with her deft fingers and loving heart is the woman of the house creating ‘the great Indian home cooked meal’.

This is where the ‘dabbawallas’ sensed a business opportunity way back in 1980 – the idea of delivering home cooked meals to office-goers and their workplace and returning empty meal boxes to their homes before their return in the evening.

Today ‘dabbawallas’ have become integral part of Mumbai’s cultural mosaic. About 5000 of these delivery men crisscross the streets, lanes and by lanes of Mumbai, on foot, bicycle and local train, every morning to deliver about 2,00,000 home cooked meal boxes to office goers at their workplaces. What amazes business strategists across the world is the unique process of near faultless delivery, which even convinced Forbes magazine to give them the highly-prized Sigma Six Rating for quality assurance, a feat achieved by companies such as Motorola and General Electrics.

“The success of the system depends on teamwork and time management that would be the envy of every modern manager. Such is the dedication and commitment of the barely literate and barefoot delivery men who form links in the extensive delivery chain, that there is no system of documentation at all.”

They do not rely on any high technology data bases or computers for communication. Instead they use colours and code markings for identification. “Each container carries an indelible ink alphanumeric coding of some ten characters signifying the various transfer and delivery stages, as well as the individuals who are to be involved in the process.”

One of the major reason for the success of this delivery service is the high-level of personal involvement, relationship orientation and continuous communication with their clients and amongst themselves.

"In the mid-fifties when GE was expanding its operations across the globe, the president of GE, Ralph Cordiner decided to set up a corporate university an hour away from New York spread over 59 acres. In 1956 GE offered its first course that spread over 13 weeks. Today no executive can imagine spending a full quarter of the year sitting in a classroom. While the courses that are offered at Crotonville have become shorter, the efficacy of the investment remains unquestionable. The headhunters refer to GE as a leadership factory.

GE is not alone. McDonalds set up its Hamburger University in 1961. When Steve Jobs hired Joe Podolny, the then dean of Yale to start Apple University in 2008 it made a big splash. Apple University drew faculty members including professors from universities like Yale, Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford and MIT.

The trend of corporate universities is on the rise. The companies have a large employee base that ranges from 8,000 to 300,000 employees or more. They cut across sectors and businesses from automobiles to pharma and everything else in between. General Motors Institute, Caterpillar, Unilever, GDF Suez, Veolia, Axa, Sanofi, Novartis, Petronas, and many more.

In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including Walt Disney, Boeing, and Motorola. According to BCG, there are estimated to be more than 4,000 companies with formal corporate universities.

Scale: McDonalds serves 68 million customers daily in 119 countries across 35,000 outlets. This complexity requires training. That ensures that McDonalds burgers taste the same from Mumbai to Moscow.

Complexity: When surgeons move to the operating theater they rely on checklists. These lists reduce human error, and help the surgeon to operate with speed without having to stop and double check if they are missing any step. In performing complex tasks through collaborating teams, speed comes through training in standard processes and procedures. Apple University teaches employees that they’re at the company to be the very best at one specific task.

Corporate Governance: Governance needs the ability to manage reporting relationships, finances, and facilities. Compliance and risk management demand investments in training. On any given day two billion people use Unilever products across countries that have different rules and regulations. This scale and complexity demands constant investment to ensure standards are not compromised.

Education: Entry-level hires are drawn from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. There is a need to bring people to a common minimum level of knowledge and skills. From technical skills or domain knowledge or personal competencies, people need to keep upgrading.

Values and Culture: The leaders need to be role models of the values the company proclaims. When the majority of employee responses to everyday situations become uniform, it forms the culture of the organization. Tying the professional development to strategic challenges is a strong reason to invest in training.
The culture of the organization has to support its vision and strategy. This needs a place when people can come together and connect with others and learn. Technical training can be delivered through e-learning modules. It is the intangibles like culture that people need to learn from role models.

The trend of corporate universities is on the rise. The companies have a large employee base that ranges from 8,000 to 300,000 employees or more. They cut across sectors and businesses from automobiles to pharma and everything else in between. General Motors Institute, Caterpillar, Unilever, GDF Suez, Veolia, Axa, Sanofi, Novartis, Petronas, and many more.

In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including Walt Disney, Boeing, and Motorola. According to BCG, there are estimated to be more than 4,000 companies with formal corporate universities.

Scale: McDonalds serves 68 million customers daily in 119 countries across 35,000 outlets. This complexity requires training. That ensures that McDonalds burgers taste the same from Mumbai to Moscow.

Complexity: When surgeons move to the operating theater they rely on checklists. These lists reduce human error, and help the surgeon to operate with speed without having to stop and double check if they are missing any step. In performing complex tasks through collaborating teams, speed comes through training in standard processes and procedures. Apple University teaches employees that they’re at the company to be the very best at one specific task.

Corporate Governance: Governance needs the ability to manage reporting relationships, finances, and facilities. Compliance and risk management demand investments in training. On any given day two billion people use Unilever products across countries that have different rules and regulations. This scale and complexity demands constant investment to ensure standards are not compromised.

Education: Entry-level hires are drawn from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. There is a need to bring people to a common minimum level of knowledge and skills. From technical skills or domain knowledge or personal competencies, people need to keep upgrading.

Values and Culture: The leaders need to be role models of the values the company proclaims. When the majority of employee responses to everyday situations become uniform, it forms the culture of the organization. Tying the professional development to strategic challenges is a strong reason to invest in training.
The culture of the organization has to support its vision and strategy. This needs a place when people can come together and connect with others and learn. Technical training can be delivered through e-learning modules. It is the intangibles like culture that people need to learn from role models.

"The Germans' insensitivity to the psychological reactions of other nations, including the neutrals, almost certainly did more harm to their cause than any amount of Allied propaganda, although even after the War they continued to insist on its effectiveness in causing them to lose the struggle. It was used as a scapegoat to maintain in effect that their army had not been beaten in the field but had been let down by those behind the lines who had allowed their minds to be poisoned by British propaganda. Historically this is wholly untrue; for towards the finale of the war civilian morale in Germany was almost certainly higher than that of the army, lulled as the people were by their home propaganda with its constant promises of an early victory and its increasingly unjustified optimism. German propaganda as a whole was indeed ineffectual, being carried out largely by army officers of the old school who did not really believe in its value. It, too, in spite of later denials, had its atrocity stories, but its worst failing was that it allowed itself to be constantly on the defensive, expending most of its energies in announcing that Allied propaganda was both untrue and unfair and making laboured attempts to correct what were regarded as false impressions. This broke one of the first rules of the propagandist, which is that his message must always be positive, never negative.
